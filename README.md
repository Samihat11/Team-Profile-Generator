## Usage

 On launch the user is prompted to answer a series of question about the team they wish to create. The manager's information is asked first then the app asks whether the user would like to add a team member. If answered `yes`, a choice between an engineer and intern is displayed. After the choice the user is prompted to give more information about the team member and the program will prompt whether to add a new team member again. If answered `no`, the program creates an `index.html` file in `dist/` folder.
